/*:
 ## App Exercise - Notifications
 
 In your app, you may want to search for other users. This would be easier with first and last names stored separately. This is not an uncommon practice.
 
 Create `firstName` and `lastName` constants and assign them string literals representing a user's first name and last name, respectively. Create a `fullName` constant that uses string concatenation to combine `firstName` and `lastName`. Print the value of `fullName`. (1 point)
 */


/*:
 Occasionally users of your app will beat previous goals or records. You may want to notify them when this happens for encouragement purposes. Create a new constant `congratulations` and assign it a string literal that uses **string interpolation** to create the following string:
 
 - "Congratulations, <INSERT USER'S FULL NAME HERE>! You beat your previous daily high score of <INSERT PREVIOUS TEST SCORE> by scoring <INSERT NEW HIGHEST TEST HERE>!"
 
 Insert `fullName`, `previousBest` and `newBest` where indicated. Print the value of `congratulations`. (1 point)
